\title{Find and Recolor Contours in a Single Image}
\usage{
ct_find(
  image,
  roi_in = NULL,
  contour_value = 0.1,
  color = "red",
  regions = 1,
  save = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{image}{The file path to the image to be analyzed.}

\item{roi_in}{An argument for delineating the region(s) of interest outside of the main function. Default is NULL and will launch a user interface so the user can draw a region(s) of interest on the image. If "roi_in" is not NULL input should be a 4-column data frame with a number of rows equal to regions. The data frame needs to contain coordinates to the region(s) of interest in the following order: top-left x, top-left y, bottom-right x, bottom-right y. Note that plotting of images by "imager" starts in the top-left corner.}

\item{contour_value}{A numeric between 0-1 for the lowest contour value you want to recolor (a low contour value captures weaker contrasts). Default is 0.1.}

\item{color}{A character string for the color of the superimposed object. Default is red.}

\item{regions}{A numeric indicating how many regions to draw. Default is 1.}

\item{save}{Logical. Save the output image. Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A recolored image. If save == TRUE, saves recolored image to working directory with "_contourr" appended to the original name.
}
\description{
Define a rectangular region and locate pixels with contour value greater than the one defined within the function. Then, recolor pixels and display recolored image.
