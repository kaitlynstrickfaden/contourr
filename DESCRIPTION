Description: This package allows the user to read in a "reference image", 
    specify a region of interest, and highlight contours within that
    region. It then finds those pixels in a new image(s) and recolors 
    them. This gives the user the ability to find an object of interest 
    in an image and overlay it onto new images. The original intent for 
    this package was to overlay a measuring stake onto images to measure
    snow with game cameras. Other potential applications are likely.
